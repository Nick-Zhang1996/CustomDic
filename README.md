This is a custom dictionary program created by Nick Zhang from NicksLab
the program basically reads in a plain text file that has multiple entries to be looked up. It then request definitions for each entry via Merriam-Webster API. Finally, it parse the returned XML file and write the output to an output file with a desired format. The program is written in C in Xcode and has been tested and only tested on Mac OS X, however, it should work on other platform with minor modification, for it mainly uses POSIX standard functions.

the online repository is not complete yet,more files need to be added if the program is to be "out of box usable"
